Trying to Learn Devops by Hands On

## What this project is about?
This project is about:
 - Understand how Devops can improve Delivery without losing quality
 - Learn and use Devops tools
 - Get a taste of what Devops Engineer is like
 - Maybe use that project as a kick start to learn cloud

## Tools used
This project simulates a Motivational Quote Picker using MongoDB, a Java BackEnd Application, and a FrontEnd Application.
As for the Devops part, I plan to use Jenkins as CI/CD and Docker to manipulate containers.
